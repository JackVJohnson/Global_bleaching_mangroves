The csv file is the final data file used for the study with all the code for analysis and figures in the codes below the csv file.

The first code (Extract_mangrove_distances.R) extracts the distance of the nearest mangrove from each site based on the geodisc. The other variables are combined to the Reef Check data in the Local_stressors and MPAs_Bleaching repositories
